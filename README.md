Started with 
https://wyeworks.com/blog/2015/6/11/how-to-build-a-rails-5-api-only-and-backbone-application
then added the public/library backbone app based on https://addyosmani.com/backbone-fundamentals/
Stumbled a bit on the rails side of things.   Tried to make good commit comments.  Need to 
recreate soon from scratch.
